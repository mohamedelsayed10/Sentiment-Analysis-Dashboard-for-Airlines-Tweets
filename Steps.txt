1 - we downloaded SQLite and odbc to open data file and access server to make CURD operations, enable live updates

2 - open data with odbc

3 - modify data with sqlite (change tweets_id) to text

4 - connect data to powerBi

5 - drop columns using powerQuery (airline_sentiment_gold, negativereason_gold, tweet_coord) too many null values

6 - we cleanded column (tweet_Created) removed (-0800) from it, to change it to clear date
	using split by location from 0 to 19 

7 - we created two columns after splitting (tweet_created1, tweet_created2), we will drop column which contain (-0800) only and keep the another one and rename it

8 - load data!

note: you can check this steps at query editor



queries to check curd operations:

INSERT into Tweets
(tweet_id, airline_sentiment, airline_sentiment_confidence, negativereason, negativereason_confidence, airline,
airline_sentiment_gold, name, negativereason_gold, retweet_count, text, tweet_coord, tweet_created, tweet_location, user_timezone)
VALUES("1","sdfsdf",545,"fsdfsdf", 44, "asdasdas","asdasd","wessam","asd",65,"wer","sdf","qwe","asd","qwe");


DELETE from Tweets where tweet_id = "1";
